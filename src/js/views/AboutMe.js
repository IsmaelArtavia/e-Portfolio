						I am a computer engineering student, my hunger for knowledge is so big, I need to know more and
						more about technology, internet, programming and logic. I like math and computers, ride my bike
						and logic video games. I am junior full stack development, more than 5 years experience in IT, I
						worked resolving problems, I like to know how the things works and get the solution to different
						problems. Not only that, but I taught math for more than 15 years, I love working with numbers,
						resolved logical problems and teaching. My favorite part of programming is front end, because I
						can see it, I need to see the webpage, do experiments with the code, learn new technologies is
						my slogan, never stop even if you are thinking.
